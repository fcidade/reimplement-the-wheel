### Reimplement the wheel

Repository so that I (@fcidade) and @gabrielEscame could learn how to implement Data Structures and Design Patterns.

#### Topics:

- Data structures:
    - Array (Fixed size)
    - Dynamic List
    - Linked List
    - Map
    - Stack
    - Queue
    - Tree
    - Graph

- Design Patterns:
    - Observer
    - Strategy
    - Composite
    - Adapter
    ...

#### Flow:
- Implement one data structure and one design pattern a day
- The first iteration should be with Javascript, with classes
    - Then, Typescript, with classes
    - Then, Typescript, but no classes allowed
    - Then, Java
    - Then, Rust
